### Title: The graph below shows average carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per person in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal between 1967 and 2007.

<br/>

The graph displays the trend of four European countries' carbon emissions from 1967 to 2007.

<br/>

From the given figures, it can be clearly observed that the carbon emissions in the UK has always been the highest among the 4 countries, and the overall changes of the figures were relatively significant.

<br/>

Generally, figures in the United Kingdom and Sweden both showed a downward tendency from 1967 to 2007 while the fluctuation of the changes in Sweden was comparatively sharper. Specifically, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Sweden experienced an increase from 8.7Mt to 10.5Mt between 1967 and 1977, which was followed by a drop to 5.5Mt in the following 30 years. Besides the carbon emissions in the UK decreased steadily from about 11Mt to 5.5Mt over the years.

<br/>

However, the figures of Italy and Portugal underwent an opposite trend over the period. In terms of Italy, a dramatic upward tendency can be observed from 4.2Mt to 6.2Mt between 1967 to 1977 before rising modernately in the following years, reaching around 7.8Mt in 2007. Thefour decades also witnessed an increase in Portugal's carbon emissions from 1Mt to 5.1Mt.

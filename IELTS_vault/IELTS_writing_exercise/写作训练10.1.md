The graph displays the pattern of how water is used for three different purposes in six areas of the world.

<br/>

From the given figures, it can be clearly observed that generally people seldom use water for domestic purposes.

<br/>

There exists huge differences in the distribution of statistics of water for industrial and agricultural purposes. In terms of industrial use, the percentage of water consumed in Europe is the highest at 53%, 5% higher than that in North America. However, the percentage of water expense for industrial purposes in Central Asia ranks the bottom at just 5%. Turning to agricultural use, it appears that people in Central Asia are most willing to use water for agricultural purposes, accounting for 84%, which is followed by the percentage of that in Africa at 4% lower, whereas 32% of water is spent on agriculture in Europe. 

<br/>

However, the gap between the data of water for domestic use is comparatively much narrower. The consumption in this aspect is the most significant in South America at 19%. ==Next comes that of Central Asia and South East Asia, where the least water is spent for domestic purposes.==

The graph display the distribution of how students who were able to speak other language in addition to English consist an England university, in 2000 and 2010.

<br/>

From the given figures, it can be clearly observed that Spanish is the most popular among the students in both years.

<br/>

There existed a small differences in the distribution of statistics in 2000. The percentage of students who could speak Spanish was the highest at 24%, twice as high as that who were able to speak French or another language. However, students who could speak German only or two other languages ranked the bottom at just 10%.

However, the gap between the data became comparatively much wider 10 years later. It appears that students were still most willing to learn Spanish, accounting for 35%, even 5% higher than 10 years before. Next comes that who could speak another language at 20%, which was followed by students who were able to speak two other languages at 5% lower, whereas only 10% of students could speak either French or German, and English only.

The graph displays the sales information of two Fairtrade&reg -labelled products in five European countries in 1999 and 2004.

<br/>

From the given figures, it can be clearly observed that bananas ==have always been== popular among Swiss people, and the overall changes of the figures were relatively moderate.

<br/>

There existed a smaller difference in the distribution of statistics in 1999. In terms of tobacco, the sales in Switzerland is the highest at 3 million euros, 1.2 million higher than that in Denmark and 2 times as high as that in the UK. However, ==tobacco seemed ==to be ==unwelcomed== in Sweden, accounting for only 0.8 million euros. Bananas were also the most popular in Switzerland among all the five countries, where bananas worth 15 million euros sold. The second place is Denmark, which had sales of less than one-seventh of Switzerland. 

<br/>

However, the gap between the data became comparatively much wider 5 years later. Sales of coffee in UK grew dramatically, reaching 20 million euros and made it the country where most coffee was sold. Switzerland ranked the second, where sales reached 6 million euros. Turning to bananas, sales in Switzerland has tripled over the years, with sales reached 46 million. Next comes that in the UK at only 5.5 million, which is followed by Belgium at 1.5 million lower, whereas bananas ,worthing only 1 million ,were sold.
